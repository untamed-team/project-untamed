# AI skill levels:
#     0:     Wild Pok√©mon
#     1-31:  Basic trainer (young/inexperienced)
#     32-47: Some skill
#     48-99: High skill
#     100+:  Best trainers (Gym Leaders, Elite Four, Champion)
# NOTE: A trainer's skill value can range from 0-255, but by default only four
#       distinct skill levels exist. The skill value is typically the same as
#       the trainer's base money value.
