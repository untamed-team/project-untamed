Methods to use in events and such:

activateQuest(quest,color=colorQuest(nil),story=false)
  -> Activates the quest with the specified quest ID, picks the display color
     for the UI, and marks whether or not it's story-related
  -> quest is the quest ACCESSOR, not number or name. So you'd use
     activateQuest(:Quest5) to activate quest #5
  -> As shown above, you do not need to put anything in the color and story
     fields if you don't need to

completeQuest(quest,color=colorQuest(nil),story=false)
  -> Completes the quest with the specified quest ID , modifying its color
     and story relevance if necessary
  -> If the quest was active, it's removed from the player's active quests
  -> As with activateQuest, you do not need to put anything in the color and 
     story fields if you don't need to
  
def failQuest(quest,color=nil,story=false)
  -> Marks the specified quest as failed, modifying its color and story 
     relevance if necessary
  -> If the quest was active, it's removed from the player's active quests
  -> As with activateQuest, you do not need to put anything in the color and 
     story fields if you don't need to
  
def advanceQuestToStage(quest,stageNum,color=nil,story=false)
  -> Moves the specified quest to the specified stage number
  -> Unlike "quest", "stageNum" here is an integer, equal to the number of the
     desired stage (the number that comes after the accessor of :StageX)
  -> It's called "advanceQuest", but it can be used to move to a lower stage 
     if needed (though you should probably try to avoid this)
  -> As with activateQuest, you do not need to put anything in the color and 
     story fields if you don't need to

def markQuestTaskComplete(quest,task,complete=true,color=nil,story=false)
  -> Marks the specified task for the specified quest as complete 
     (complete = true) or incomplete (complete = false)
  -> If you only enter the quest ID and task #, the task will be marked as
     complete. If you wish to mark it as incomplete, put false (as a boolean
     value, not a string) into the "complete" field
  -> Unlike "quest", "task" here is an integer, equal to the number of the
     desired task (the number that comes after the accessor of :TaskX)
  -> As with activateQuest, you do not need to put anything in the color and 
     story fields if you don't need to
