#=============================================================================
# Rotatona Puzzle
#=============================================================================
#rules for making a puzzle:
#1. all events must have one of these names
#	RotaPuzzle_Disc
#	RotaPuzzle_Launcher_Rotatable
#	RotaPuzzle_Launcher_Overlay_Rotatable
#	RotaPuzzle_Launcher_Stationary
#	RotaPuzzle_Launcher_Overlay_Stationary
#	RotaPuzzle_Catcher
#	RotaPuzzle_Ramp
#	RotaPuzzle_StraightTrack
#	RotaPuzzle_CornerTrack
#2. All launchers' associated overlays must be on the same Y as the associated launcher, and the overlay must be 1 to the right of the launcher (e.g. launcher x is 10 and y is 20, associated overlay x is 11 and y is 20)
#3. Launcher overlays must have "Always on Top" checked
#4. Launcher overlays must have an event number higher than all Rotatona discs
#5. Rotatona discs must have "Always on Top" checked
#6. Launcher events must be 3x3 ( e.g. NAME,size(3,3) )
#7. Launcher overlay events must be 1x3 ( e.g. NAME,size(1,3) )
#8. All rotatble launchers and launchers which are stationary and not facing down need an associated launcher overlay
#9. Rotatona disc events must be placed 1 to the right and 1 up from the launcher you want it to start in
#10. Do not use terrain tags 19 through 29 for anything. Do not change the terrain tags on any of the tiles in the temple tileset
#11. Do not put events on top of track tiles from the tileset and expect them to work. The script checks for collisions with the track tiles FIRST, then processes any track events if not touching any track tiles
#12. Disc catcher events' ID numbers must be higher than disc events' IDs
#13. Disc catcher must have "Always on Top" checked

#logic to do:
#disc is always on top of player when launched; might need to move player farther away from track
#When a Rota crashes, The screen should go black and the rota should reset back to its last launcher as the camera shifts back to the player
#make followers go into ball when launching disc and come out when camera pans back to player and player unlocks

#Upon reentry to the room, the puzzle should reset entirely unless the puzzle has already been fully completed. At which point it shouldn’t reset at all;
#DONE All events should keep their current position and states when reloading the game;
#only reset getPuzzleEvents and reset positions when leaving and re-entering the map, including discs "pbMoveRoute(event, [PBMoveRoute::AlwaysOnTopOff])" if docked in a catcher. I need to move puzzle pieces from $game_temp to something that saves with the save file. I might need to do this because currently it's working

#resetting rota when it crashes:
#A Rota only resets itself, not other Rotas or puzzle pieces. The entire puzzle should reset itself when exiting the room unless it has already been fully solved
#if collide with disc, crash any rolling disc, so if one is in a catcher and the other crashes into it, the caught one or docked one (launcher) does not break

#bugs
#if launching rota at the bottom launcher, the top launcher looks upward
#when the game waits a second after docking a disc, the disc is not done moving (graphics-wise)
