# Full Odds Tracker
# This adds the method 'full_odds' to pokemon, that returns false if any shiny
# odds affecting mechanics are in play. It does it's best to catch this at
# all passes - if the shininess is re-rolled, if the shininess is set to true,
# or if specific mechanics are in play like the shiny charm or masuda method.
#
# This should catch mostly everything, but you can edit the event handlers to
# add some custom stuff if you want.
