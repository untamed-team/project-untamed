Contests rework ideas:
contests notes:
pkmn moves do not have set type like cool or smart
Instead, a pkmn who has used X move many times, has proficiency in the move
The higher the proficiency, the better the move scores

Elin thinks that stuffing a pkmn with candy to raise coolness, cuteness, etc., isn't fun
We could repurpose the candy making or scrap it altogether and do something else to raise coolness, cuteness, etc. stats on a specific pkmn
