Multi Page Demo,1,true
2,1) I made this Quest
2,2) With the specific intent of having so many objectives
2,3) The quest log would have to display it on multiple pages
2,4) in order to showcase how it'd work.
2,5) First, you'll notice that even if some objectives
2,6) are hidden while the next one is revealed,
2,7) the script will process it accordingly and display the next goal in it's place. 
0,8) That way, even if you can't see this message, there's no blanks in that screen!
1,9) As you can see, it displays arrows indicating whether there's stuff or not remaining
2,10) to display, so the player knows to check for another page.
1,11) However, the whole process is, it turns out, somewhat consuming on the game.
1,12) You can notice a slight delay when opening that quest page.
1,13) There's complicated reasons behind it, so if you're unfamilliar with scripting
1,14Just know that the bottom line is that this script is pain. 
2,15) Thankfully, this lag should only come up for quests that long.
1,16) And, to be frank, you probably shouldn't be making quests this big
2,17) Would be way better to make separate quests, both for you and the player.
0,18) Oh cool we're reaching the end I can stop talking.
1,19) So anyway, how was your day ?
