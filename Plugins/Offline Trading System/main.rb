#Offline trading system
#TO DO:
#as a backup, i would do some checks at the end of the trade:
#does this savefile have a pokemon with the exact same pkmnID? If so, the alien pokemon is deleted
#if the pokemon received is above the badge level, the pokemon will always disobey. No ifs or buts
#everytime a pokemon is deleted/added, the game automatically saves. The player does not confirm to save, the game forces the player to do so
